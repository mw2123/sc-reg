# sc-reg

This repository contains a bash script (SC_registration.sh) used to conduct nonlinear registration of spinal cord fMRI data to PAM50 template space.

SC_registration.sh references command line tools that are part of FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) and SCT (https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/). It is intended to be run on a dataset formatted to the BIDS specification: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

The script was originally created by Kenneth Weber and was subsequently modified by Mark Hoggarth and Max Wang.
